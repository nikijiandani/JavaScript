		<h3>JavaScript Objects</h3>
		<p>Objects are just collections of key-value pairs, or in other words, pieces of data mapped to unique identifiers that we call properties or keys. We can access properties of objects using the dot or bracket notation. We use quotes when using bracket notation because the brackets also allow us to pass a variable in to be evaluated as a property name. If we pass in a property without the quotes, the JavaScript engine will attempt to evaluate it as a variable and throw a <code>ReferenceError: ***** is not defined</code>. We can also add new key-value pairs to objects using this same syntax. Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.</p>

		<h3>More arrays</h3>
		<p>The Spread operator <code>...</code> allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements in order. The spread operator also lets you combine arrays, or let you insert all the elements of one array onto another at any index.</p>
		<p><code>indexOf()</code> takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position or index of that element or <code>-1</code> if the element doesnt not exist on the array. It can be incredibly useful for quickly checking for the presence of an element on an array.</p>
		<p>Iterate over an array using a <code>for </code>loop.</p>

		<h3>Arrays are mutable</h3>
		<p><b>Multi dimensional array</b> - meaning it is an array that contains other arrays.</p>
		<p>You can access an Array's contents using bracket notation. In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly to a variable which references an array object. In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation.</p>
		<p>We can programmatically modify an array using <code>Array.push()</code> and <code>Array.unshift() </code>. The <code>push()</code> method adds elements to the end of an array and the <code>unshift()</code> adds elements to the beginning.</p>
		<p>We can remove items form an array with <code>pop()</code> and <code>shift()</code> however these methods dont take any parameters. They only let us modify the array by a single element at a time. <code>pop() </code> removes an element from the end of an array while <code>shift() </code>removes an element from the beginning. </p>
		<p><code>splice() </code> allows us to remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array. <code>splice()</code>'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. <code>splice()</code> not only modifies the array it's being called on but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements. <code>splice() </code>can also be used to add items using the third parameter.</p>
		<p><code>slice() </code>, rather than modifying an array, copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it was called upon untouched. It takes 2 parameters - the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction(extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index).</p>

		<h3>Basic Data Structures</h3>
		<p>One-dimensional array - meaning it only has one level or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Arrays have a length property which can be accessed with the syntax <code>Array.length</code>.</p>

	<h3>Falsy values in JavaScript</h3>
	<p><code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>(an empty string), <code>NaN</code>, <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code>.</p>
