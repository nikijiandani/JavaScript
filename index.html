		<p>The <code>isPrototypeOf()</code> method checks if an object exists in another object's prototype chain.</p>
		<p>All objects in JavaScript(with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also an object's prototype itself is an object. Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have it's own prototype!</p>
		<p><code>Object</code> is a <code>supertype</code> for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore any object can use the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method.</p>
		<p>Use inheritance so you don't repeat yourself.</p>
		<p>JavaScript is an object-based language based on prototypes, rather than being class-based.</p>
		<p>The <code>Object.create()</code> method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. Inherited properties can be overwritten.</p>
		<p>When an object inherits its <code>prototype</code> from another object, it also inherits the <code>supertype</code>'s constructor property.</p>
		<p>A constructor function that inherits its <code>prototype</code> object from a <code>supertype</code> constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.</p>
		<p>An object can inherit its behavior(methods) from another object by cloning its <code>prototype</code> object:</p>
		<p><code>ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);</code></p>
		<p>Then the <code>ChildObject</code> received its own methods by chaining them onto its <code>prototype:</code></p>
		<p><code>ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...}</code></p>
		<p>It's possible to override an inherited method. It's done the same way - by adding a method to <code>ChildObject.prototype</code> using the same method name as the one to override.</p>
		<p>You can use a <code>mixin</code> to add common behavior between unrelated objects. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.</p>

		<h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
		<p>Object oriented programming organizes code into object definitions. These are sometimes called classes and they group together data with related behaviour. The data is an object's attributes and the behaviour(or functions) are methods.</p>
		<p>The object structure makes it flexible within a program. Objects can transfer information by calling and passing data to another object's methods. Also, new classes can recieve or inherit all the features from a base or parent class. This helps to reduce repeated code.</p>
		<p>Objects in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them properties and behaviour just like their real world counterparts.</p>
		<p>You can use dot notation to access the properties of an Object.</p>
		<p>Objects can have a special type of property called a method. Methods are properties that are functions. This adds different behaviour to an object.</p>
		<p>You can make code more usable with the <code>this</code> keyword to reference the original name of the object.</p>
		<p><code>Constructors</code> are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviours that will belong to the new object.</p>
		<p><code>Constructors</code> follow a few conventions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>Constructors</code> are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.</li>
			<li><code>Constructors</code> use the keyword <code>this</code> to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.</li>
			<li><code>Constructors</code> define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You need to use the <code>new</code> operator when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance. Without the <code>new</code> operator, <code>this</code> inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results.</p>
		<p>You can design constructors to accept parameters. Then pass in the values as arguments. This way, the constructor is more flexible and It's now possible to define the properties for each object at the time it is created. JavaScript constructors group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.</p>
		<p>Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the <code>instanceof</code> operator. <code>instanceof</code> allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor.</p>
		<p><b>Own Properties</b> are properties that are defined directly on the instance object. The <code>hasOwnProperty()</code> method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).</p>
		<p><b>Note: hasOwnProperty returns true even if the value of the property is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined.</code></b></p>
		<p><b>Use prototype properties to reduce duplicate code.</b> The prototype is an object that is shared among all instances of the Object. Since all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, prototype is like a "recipe" for creating objects. Nearly every object in JavaScript has a prototype property which is part of the constructor function that created it.</p>
		<p>Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. And prototype properties are defined on the prototype.</p>
		<p>The <code>in</code> operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain.</p>
		<p>There is a special constructor property located on the object instances. The constructor property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance. The advantage of the constructor property is that it's possible to check for this property to find out what kind of object it is.</p>
		<p><b>Note: Since the constructor property can be overwritten, it's generally better to use instanceof method to check the type of an object.</b></p>
		<p>Adding properties to the prototype individually is tedious. A more efficient way is to set the prototype to a new object that already contains the properties. This way the properties are added all at once.</p>
		<p>There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. It erases the constructor property! To fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the constructor property.</p>
		<p>An object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it.</p>

		<p>The <code>parseInt()</code> funvtion parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix(the base in mathematical numeral systems)</p>
		<p>The <code>findIndex()</code> method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating no element passed the test.</p>
		<p>The <code>concat()</code> method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays but instead returns a new array.</p>
		<h3>Method chaining in JavaScript</h3>
		<p>Method chaining is a technique that can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions on the same object consecutively. The typical way to enable method chaining is to return the current object at the end of every function.</p>
		<p>The <code>every()</code> method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns true if the callback function returns a truthy value for every array element; otherwise false.</p>

		<h3>The built in JavaScript Boolean method</h3>
		<p>The value passed as the first parameter is converted to a boolean value, if necessary. If the value is omitted or is 0, -0, null false, NaN, undefined or an empty string(""), the object has an initial value of false. All other values, including any object or the string "false", create an object with an initial value of true.</p>
		<p><b>Do not confuse the primitive Boolean values true and false with the true and false values of the Boolean object.</b></p>
		<p>The <code>filter()</code> method creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.</p>

		<p>The <code>replace()</code> method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match. If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. The original string is left unchanged.</p>

		<p><b>The conditional(ternary) Operator</b> is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
		<p>The <code>find()</code> method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise undefined is returned.</p>
		<h3>Primitive</h3>
		<p>A primitive(primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol(new in ECMAScript 2015). Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.</p>
		<p>All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be assigned a new value, but the existing value cannot be changed in the ways that objects, arrays and functions can be altered.</p>
		<p><b>A primitive can be replaced, but it can't be directly altered.</b></p>
		<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.</p>

		<h3>JavaScript substring methods</h3>
		<p>The <code>substring()</code> method returns the part of the string between the start and the end indexes, or to the end of the string.</p>
		<p>The <code>slice()</code> method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.</p>
		<p>The <code>endsWith()</code> method determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.</p>

		<h3>Recursion in JavaScript</h3>
		<p>Loosely defined, recursion is the process of taking a big problem and sub-dividing it into multiple , smaller instances of the same problem. Put into practice, that generally means writing a function that calls itself.</p>
		<p><code>Math.max()</code> returns the largest of zero or more numbers.</p>
		<p>The <code>map()</code> method creates a new array with the results if calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.</p>
		<p>The <code>reduce()</code> method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array resulting in a single output value.</p>

		<p>The<code>split()</code>method splits a String object into an array of strings by seperating the string into substrings, using a specified seperator string to determine where to make each split.</p>
		<p>The <code>reverse()</code> method reverses an array. The first array element becomes the last and the last array element becomes the first. Reverse is destructive. It also changes the original array.</p>
		<p>The <code>join()</code> method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array(or an array like object), seperated by commas or a specified seperator string.</p>

		<p>We can generate an array of all object keys with <code>Object.keys()</code>. This will return an array with strings representing each property in the object. There will be no specific order to the entries in the array.</p>
		<h3>Basic Algorithm scripting</h3>
		<p>A computer algorithm is a sequence of steps that is followed to achieve a particular outcome. To write an algorithm, you must first understand a problem, and then solve it with coding. To make problem solving easier, it can be helpful to break them down into many chunks. Then each chunk can be solved one by one.</p>

		<h3>JavaScript Objects</h3>
		<p>Objects are just collections of key-value pairs, or in other words, pieces of data mapped to unique identifiers that we call properties or keys. We can access properties of objects using the dot or bracket notation. We use quotes when using bracket notation because the brackets also allow us to pass a variable in to be evaluated as a property name. If we pass in a property without the quotes, the JavaScript engine will attempt to evaluate it as a variable and throw a <code>ReferenceError: ***** is not defined</code>. We can also add new key-value pairs to objects using this same syntax. Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.</p>
		<p>Use the <code>delete</code> keyword to remove Object properties.</p>
		<p>We can check if an Object has a property using the <code>hasOwnProperty()</code> method or the <code>in</code> keyword.</p>
		<p>Use the <code>for...in</code> statement to iterate through all the keys within an object.</p>
		<p>Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays do; thus a keys position on an object, or the relative order in which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that key.</p>

		<h3>More arrays</h3>
		<p>The Spread operator <code>...</code> allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements in order. The spread operator also lets you combine arrays, or let you insert all the elements of one array onto another at any index.</p>
		<p><code>indexOf()</code> takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position or index of that element or <code>-1</code> if the element doesnt not exist on the array. It can be incredibly useful for quickly checking for the presence of an element on an array.</p>
		<p>Iterate over an array using a <code>for </code>loop.</p>

		<h3>Arrays are mutable</h3>
		<p><b>Multi dimensional array</b> - meaning it is an array that contains other arrays.</p>
		<p>You can access an Array's contents using bracket notation. In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly to a variable which references an array object. In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation.</p>
		<p>We can programmatically modify an array using <code>Array.push()</code> and <code>Array.unshift() </code>. The <code>push()</code> method adds elements to the end of an array and the <code>unshift()</code> adds elements to the beginning.</p>
		<p>We can remove items form an array with <code>pop()</code> and <code>shift()</code> however these methods dont take any parameters. They only let us modify the array by a single element at a time. <code>pop() </code> removes an element from the end of an array while <code>shift() </code>removes an element from the beginning. </p>
		<p><code>splice() </code> allows us to remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array. <code>splice()</code>'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. <code>splice()</code> not only modifies the array it's being called on but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements. <code>splice() </code>can also be used to add items using the third parameter.</p>
		<p><code>slice() </code>, rather than modifying an array, copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it was called upon untouched. It takes 2 parameters - the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction(extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index).</p>
