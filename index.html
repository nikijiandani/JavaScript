		<h3>The built in JavaScript Boolean method</h3>
		<p>The value passed as the first parameter is converted to a boolean value, if necessary. If the value is omitted or is 0, -0, null false, NaN, undefined or an empty string(""), the object has an initial value of false. All other values, including any object or the string "false", create an object with an initial value of true.</p>
		<p><b>Do not confuse the primitive Boolean values true and false with the true and false values of the Boolean object.</b></p>
		<p>The <code>filter()</code> method creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.</p>

		<p>The <code>replace()</code> method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match. If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced. The original string is left unchanged.</p>

		<p>The <code>toUpperCase()</code> method returns the calling string value converted to uppercase(the value will be converted to a string if it isnt one.)</p>
		<p>The <code>toLowerCase()</code> method returns the callung string value converted to lower case.</p>

		<p><b>The conditional(ternary) Operator</b> is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
		<p>The <code>find()</code> method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise undefined is returned.</p>
		<h3>Primitive</h3>
		<p>A primitive(primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol(new in ECMAScript 2015). Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.</p>
		<p>All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be assigned a new value, but the existing value cannot be changed in the ways that objects, arrays and functions can be altered.</p>
		<p><b>A primitive can be replaced, but it can't be directly altered.</b></p>
		<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.</p>

		<h3>JavaScript substring methods</h3>
		<p>The <code>substring()</code> method returns the part of the string between the start and the end indexes, or to the end of the string.</p>
		<p>The <code>slice()</code> method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.</p>
		<p>The <code>endsWith()</code> method determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.</p>

		<h3>Recursion in JavaScript</h3>
		<p>Loosely defined, recursion is the process of taking a big problem and sub-dividing it into multiple , smaller instances of the same problem. Put into practice, that generally means writing a function that calls itself.</p>
		<p><code>Math.max()</code> returns the largest of zero or more numbers.</p>
		<p>The <code>map()</code> method creates a new array with the results if calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.</p>
		<p>The <code>reduce()</code> method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array resulting in a single output value.</p>

		<p>The<code>split()</code>method splits a String object into an array of strings by seperating the string into substrings, using a specified seperator string to determine where to make each split.</p>
		<p>The <code>reverse()</code> method reverses an array. The first array element becomes the last and the last array element becomes the first. Reverse is destructive. It also changes the original array.</p>
		<p>The <code>join()</code> method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array(or an array like object), seperated by commas or a specified seperator string.</p>

		<p>We can generate an array of all object keys with <code>Object.keys()</code>. This will return an array with strings representing each property in the object. There will be no specific order to the entries in the array.</p>
		<h3>Basic Algorithm scripting</h3>
		<p>A computer algorithm is a sequence of steps that is followed to achieve a particular outcome. To write an algorithm, you must first understand a problem, and then solve it with coding. To make problem solving easier, it can be helpful to break them down into many chunks. Then each chunk can be solved one by one.</p>

		<h3>JavaScript Objects</h3>
		<p>Objects are just collections of key-value pairs, or in other words, pieces of data mapped to unique identifiers that we call properties or keys. We can access properties of objects using the dot or bracket notation. We use quotes when using bracket notation because the brackets also allow us to pass a variable in to be evaluated as a property name. If we pass in a property without the quotes, the JavaScript engine will attempt to evaluate it as a variable and throw a <code>ReferenceError: ***** is not defined</code>. We can also add new key-value pairs to objects using this same syntax. Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.</p>
		<p>Use the <code>delete</code> keyword to remove Object properties.</p>
		<p>We can check if an Object has a property using the <code>hasOwnProperty()</code> method or the <code>in</code> keyword.</p>
		<p>Use the <code>for...in</code> statement to iterate through all the keys within an object.</p>
		<p>Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays do; thus a keys position on an object, or the relative order in which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that key.</p>

		<h3>More arrays</h3>
		<p>The Spread operator <code>...</code> allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements in order. The spread operator also lets you combine arrays, or let you insert all the elements of one array onto another at any index.</p>
		<p><code>indexOf()</code> takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position or index of that element or <code>-1</code> if the element doesnt not exist on the array. It can be incredibly useful for quickly checking for the presence of an element on an array.</p>
		<p>Iterate over an array using a <code>for </code>loop.</p>

		<h3>Arrays are mutable</h3>
		<p><b>Multi dimensional array</b> - meaning it is an array that contains other arrays.</p>
		<p>You can access an Array's contents using bracket notation. In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly to a variable which references an array object. In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation.</p>
		<p>We can programmatically modify an array using <code>Array.push()</code> and <code>Array.unshift() </code>. The <code>push()</code> method adds elements to the end of an array and the <code>unshift()</code> adds elements to the beginning.</p>
		<p>We can remove items form an array with <code>pop()</code> and <code>shift()</code> however these methods dont take any parameters. They only let us modify the array by a single element at a time. <code>pop() </code> removes an element from the end of an array while <code>shift() </code>removes an element from the beginning. </p>
		<p><code>splice() </code> allows us to remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array. <code>splice()</code>'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. <code>splice()</code> not only modifies the array it's being called on but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements. <code>splice() </code>can also be used to add items using the third parameter.</p>
		<p><code>slice() </code>, rather than modifying an array, copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it was called upon untouched. It takes 2 parameters - the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction(extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index).</p>

		<h3>Basic Data Structures</h3>
		<p>One-dimensional array - meaning it only has one level or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Arrays have a length property which can be accessed with the syntax <code>Array.length</code>.</p>
